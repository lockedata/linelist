\usage{
guess_dates(x, error_tolerance = 0.1, first_date = NULL,
  last_date = Sys.Date(), orders = getOption("linelist_guess_orders"),
  quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{character} vector or a \code{factor}}

\item{error_tolerance}{a number between 0 and 1 indicating the proportion of
entries which cannot be identified as dates to be tolerated; if this
proportion is exceeded, the original vector is returned, and a message is
issued; defaults to 0.1 (10 percent)}

\item{first_date}{a Date object specifying the first valid date. Defaults to
fifty years before the \code{last_date}.}

\item{last_date}{a Date object specifying the last valid date. Defaults to the
current date.}

\item{orders}{date codes for fine-grained parsing of dates. This allows for
parsing of mixed dates. If a list is supplied, that list will be used for
successive tries in parsing.  This is passed on to
\code{\link[lubridate:parse_date_time]{lubridate::parse_date_time()}}. Default orders
(\code{getOption("linelist_guess_orders")}) parse World dmy/dby dates before US
mdy/bdy dates.}

\item{quiet}{a logical indicating if messages should be displayed to the
console (\code{TRUE}, default); set to \code{FALSE} to silence messages}
}
\description{
Note that THIS FEATURE IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL: we strongly recommend checking
a few converted dates manually. This function tries to extract dates from a
\code{character} vector or a \code{factor}. It treats each entry independently, using
regular expressions to detect if a date is present, its format, and if
successful it converts that entry to a standard \code{Date} with the \emph{Ymd} format
(e.g. \code{2018-01-21}). Entries which cannot be processed result in \code{NA}. An
error threshold can be used to define the maximum number of resulting \code{NA}
(i.e. entries without an identified date) that can be tolerated. If this
threshold is exceeded, the original vector is returned.
}
\details{
Converting ambiguous character strings to dates is difficult for
many reasons:
\itemize{
\item dates may not use the standard Ymd format
\item within the same variable, dates may follow different formats
\item dates may be mixed with things that are not dates
\item the behaviour of \code{as.Date} in the presence of non-date is hard to predict,
sometimes returning \code{NA}, sometimes issuing an error.
}

This function tries to address all the above issues. Dates with the following
format should be automatically detected, irrespective of separators
(e.g. "-", " ", "/") and surrounding text:
\itemize{
\item "19 09 2018"
\item "2018 09 19"
\item "19 Sep 2018"
\item "2018 Sep 19"
\item "Sep 19 2018"
}

\subsection{How it works}{

This function relies heavily on \code{\link[lubridate:parse_date_time]{lubridate::parse_date_time()}}, which is an
extremely flexible date parser that works well for consistent date formats,
but can quickly become unweildy and may produce spurious results.
\code{guess_dates()} will use a list of formats in the \code{orders} argument to run
\code{parse_date_time()} with each format vector separately and take the first
correctly parsed date from all the trials. By default, the orders are in
\code{getOption("linelist_guess_orders")}:\preformatted{list(
  world_named_months = c("Ybd", "dby"),
  world_digit_months = c("dmy", "Ymd"), 
  US_formats         = c("Omdy", "YOmd")
)
}

In this case, the dates 03 Jan 2018, 07/03/1982, and 08/20/85 are correctly
intepreted as 2018-01-03, 1982-03-07, and 1985-08-20. The examples section
will show how you can manipulate the \code{orders} to be customised for your
situation.

\examples{

guess_dates(c("03 Jan 2018", "07/03/1982", "08/20/85")) # default

# The default orders prioritize world date ordering over American-style.
print(ord <- getOption("linelist_guess_orders"))

# if you want to prioritize American-style dates with numeric months, you
# can switch the second and third elements of the default orders
ord[c(1, 3, 2)]
guess_dates(c("03 Jan 2018", "07/03/1982", "08/20/85"), orders = ord[c(1, 3, 2)])

# If you have a format with hours, minutes and seconds, you can add that to
# the list
ord$ymdhms <- c("Ymdhms", "Ymdhm")

guess_dates(c("2014_04_05_23:15:43", "03 Jan 2018", "07/03/1982", "08/20/85"), orders = ord)

# guess_dates can handle messy dates and tolerate missing data
x <- c("01-12-2001", "male", "female", "2018-10-18", NA, NA, "2018_10_17",
      "2018 10 19", "// 24/12/1989", "this is 24/12/1989!",
      "RECON NGO: 19 Sep 2018 :)", "6/9/11", "10/10/10")

guess_dates(x, error_tolerance = 1) # forced conversion

guess_dates(x, error_tolerance = 0.15) # only 15\% errors allowed
